	"contentPreview": "My original reason for writing this post was that, some time ago, I felt that the Microsoft documentation for pattern matching in C# did not fully communicate all the cool things you could do with pattern matching in everyday code. Since then, I have come across [this very succinctly summary of Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching) from Microsoft. However, I thought that this post could still serve benefit as an introduction in using pattern matching to make everyday code more concise.",
