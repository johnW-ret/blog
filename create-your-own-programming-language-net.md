# Create Your own .NET Programming Language

#### Write a mini programming language that outputs valid CIL in a notebook in under an hour

Have you ever wondered how programming languages work? Have you ever wanted to create your own?

Have you ever had the oddly specific desire for someone to create a mini-language in a [Polyglot Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/polyglot), so that you can run the code and follow along step by step?

Well, if so, [you're in luck](https://github.dev/johnW-ret/Retruate.Languages/blob/main/learn/recursive-descent.ipynb)!

There are actually plenty of online tutorials and StackOverflow posts about how to implement parsers and compiler algorithms, but I have yet to find an example that carries the reader from start to finish - from defining a grammar to emitting bytecode.

Instead of providing more details here, I will defer to the above notebook, as it is a live link to a GitHub repository, and I anticipate to make future changes - changes I would prefer to make once, not twice.

However, while the above link is enough to get you started, I would recommend you install the [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) on VS Code, back on your browser, click "GitHub" in the bottom-left corner, then select "Continue Working in Remote Repsitory on VS Code Desktop". That way, you'll get nicer syntax highlighting and can run the code locally.
